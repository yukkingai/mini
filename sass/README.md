# Multimedia Authoring 2 - Favourite Things

This is a project to showcase about what some of my favourite things are. There are three major things that I love a lot in my life, they are psychology, hiking and stationery. In this project, I will show users what aspects of these things that I love and to understand why I love them by text, videos and  photos. Yes! I love visual as well.

SASS and JS components will be used for this project to simplified css and javascript input. Data.json will be stored and retrieved data of my favourite things that included why I like them and how they influence my life.
